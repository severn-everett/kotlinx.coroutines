/**
 * Waits for the result of multiple suspending functions simultaneously, which are specified using _clauses_
 * in the [builder] scope of this select invocation. The caller is suspended until one of the clauses
 * is either _selected_ or _fails_.
 *
 * At most one clause is *atomically* selected and its block is executed. The result of the selected clause
 * becomes the result of the select. If any clause _fails_, then the select invocation produces the
 * corresponding exception. No clause is selected in this case.
 *
 * This select function is _biased_ to the first clause. When multiple clauses can be selected at the same time,
 * the first one of them gets priority. Use [selectUnbiased] for an unbiased (randomized) selection among
 * the clauses.

 * There is no `default` clause for select expression. Instead, each selectable suspending function has the
 * corresponding non-suspending version that can be used with a regular `when` expression to select one
 * of the alternatives or to perform the default (`else`) action if none of them can be immediately selected.
 *
 * ### List of supported select methods
 *
 * | **Receiver**     | **Suspending function**                           | **Select clause**
 * | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------     | -----------------------------------------------------
 * | [Job]            | [join][Job.join]                                  | [onJoin][Job.onJoin]
 * | [Deferred]       | [await][Deferred.await]                           | [onAwait][Deferred.onAwait]
 * | [SendChannel]    | [send][SendChannel.send]                          | [onSend][SendChannel.onSend]
 * | [ReceiveChannel] | [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive]                 | [onReceive][ReceiveChannel.onReceive]
 * | [ReceiveChannel] | [receiveCatching][ReceiveChannel.receiveCatching] | [onReceiveCatching][ReceiveChannel.onReceiveCatching]
 * | none             | [delay]                                           | [onTimeout][SelectBuilder.onTimeout]
 *
 * This suspending function is cancellable. If the [Job] of the current coroutine is cancelled or completed while this
 * function is suspended, this function immediately resumes with [CancellationException].
 * There is a **prompt cancellation guarantee**. If the job was cancelled while this function was
 * suspended, it will not resume successfully. See [suspendCancellableCoroutine] documentation for low-level details.
 *
 * Note that this function does not check for cancellation when it is not suspended.
 * Use [yield] or [CoroutineScope.isActive] to periodically check for cancellation in tight loops if needed.
